All good ideas look like bad ideas to those who are losers.
                -- Dilbert


"And kids... learn something from Susie and Eddie.
 If you think there's a maniacal psycho-geek in the
 basement:
    1)Don't give him a chance to hit you on the
head with an axe!
    2)Flee the premises... even if you're in your
underwear.
    3)Warn the neighbors and call the police.
 But whatever else you do... DON'T GO DOWN IN THE DAMN BASEMENT!"
-- Saturday Night Live meets Friday the 13th
